📽️ Cinephile Junction – Movie Recommendation Website
Cinephile Junction is a simple movie recommendation website built using HTML and CSS, with some basic JavaScript.

This project was created during the 2nd year of my engineering studies as part of my web development practice. It allows users to explore movie suggestions based on genres like Action, Comedy, Sci-Fi, and more.
